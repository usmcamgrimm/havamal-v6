Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!
Two weeks have now passed since our long voyage to Bornholm and Raise Your Horns festival .
We are still overwhelmed by the welcome we got, but also by the professional crew and the other bands who played. 
We surely had a great time and can't wait to come back one day!
Mange Tak!!
Here' some photos taken during soundcheck, the gig, but also some from day after the plunder.
We also have some really good videos from the festival on our YouTube channel.
