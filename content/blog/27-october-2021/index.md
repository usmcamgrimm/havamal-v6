Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Odin's faithful ravens brings whispers from the realms of a coming storm over Frankia.

On February 20th, We, the hymn-weavers of Havamal will set our drakkars course to the shores of Paris, France, to give a musical raid at [Cernunnos Pagan Fest](https://www.facebook.com/cernunnos.festival/)!

Prepare Europe, the flames of the old gods will reach you soon enough..

Hail Cerunnos! Hail those that will join our battle! Hail you that reads this! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
