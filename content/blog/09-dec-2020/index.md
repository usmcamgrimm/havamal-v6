Einherjars and Valkyries, heed!
The raven bring winged whispers of a mighty update from the SolnaSound Recording forge; All vocals are finished for the upcoming saga!
These mighty tunes roars like a deafening thunder across the blackened skies like struck from the hammer of Thor itself! All being kneels at its echo, and even the World-Tree itself will bow in fear when it's heard!
Our album draws ever closer, faithful horde! Stay vigilant..
Hail Solna Sound Recording! Hail our written hymns! Hail Bj√∂rn! Hail our warriors of Odin! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
