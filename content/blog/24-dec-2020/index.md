Havamal wishes all our Einherjars and Valkyries a fantastic Yuletide and let Sol once more close in on her reign across the frostborne skies when We usher into the closing days of 2020!
New album and hopefully live events on the horizon, the hymn-weavers and Odin's gift from all of us to all of our warriors out there! Let the mead flow like wine, and remember; if you can't remember it, it must've been one Hel of a party!

Hail the Yuletide! Hail Odin Claus! Hail the new year! F.ck covid! Hail the coming of a new album! Hail Odin! Hail Havamal! But first and foremost, hail our amazing hordes that keep our flame and spirit alive!
